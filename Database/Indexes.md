Which of the following statement is true about row locators in non-clustered indexes in MS SQL Server?

- If the table does not have a clustered index, the row locator is the clustered index key for the row.
- If the table has a clustered index, or the index is on an indexed view, the row locator is a pointer to the row.
- **If the table has a clustered index, or the index is on an indexed view, the row locator is the clustered index key for the row.**
- None of the above-mentioned statement is true.

Consider the following two designs to store the data using clustered indexes in MS SQL Server:

    In the first design, the fill factor is 20% and the total number of free rows per page are A.

    In the second design, the fill factor is 40% and the total number of free rows per page are B.

Which the followings describes the relation between A and B:

- **A = 1.33B**
- B = 1.33A
- A = 0.67B
- B = 0.67A

The correct syntax for creating composite indexes in MS SQL Sever is:
- <p>CREATE INDEX index_name</p> <p>ON table_name(column1), table_name(column2);</p>
- <p>CREATE INDEX index_name</p> <p>ON table_name(column1) and table_name(column2);</p>
- **<p>CREATE INDEX index_name</p> <p>ON table_name(column1, column2);</p>**
- <p>All the above-mentioned syntax are correct.</p>
